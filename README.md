# Simple Raster G-code Generator for Foam Cutting and Lightweight CNCs (CostyCNC Demo)

[🔗 Try the Web App](https://costycnc.github.io/raster-gcode-cm10/)

This is a **beginner-friendly**, web-based tool to convert black-and-white images into raster-style G-code for **lightweight CNC machines**, like foam cutters and laser engravers.

It is part of the **CostyCNC** project — a compact, essential CNC designed for cutting polystyrene and other light materials.

> ⚠️ **NOTE:** This version is only a demo. It does **not control motors** or connect to a real machine. The full working version is integrated in the CostyCNC system via the MKS DLC32 board.
